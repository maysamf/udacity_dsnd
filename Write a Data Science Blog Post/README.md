## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

This code runs with Python version 3.* and there should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.


## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

This is an Udacity Nanodegree project.I was interested in using Movelens data set from The GroupLens Research Project. The data contain 1,000,209 anonymous ratings of approximately 3,900 movies
made by 6,040 MovieLens users who joined MovieLens in 2000. </br>
I am interested in finding answers to the following questions:</br>
1. What are the age groups of the users? </br>
2. What are the ratings of Toy Story 2015 movie? </br>
3. What are the top 25 movies by ratings? </br>

Finally, I tried to use a simple ML algorithm to predict the ratings of a movie based on the user demographics.

## File Description <a name="files"></a>

**Project4.ipynb**: Notebook containing the data analysis. </br>
**movies.dat**: Movies information are in this file. </br>
**ratings.dat**: All the ratings are contained in this file. </br>
**users.dat**: User information are in this file. </br>

## Results <a name="results"></a>
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here]()
