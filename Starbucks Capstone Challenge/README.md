This code runs with Python version 3.* and there should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.


## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

This is part of Udacity Nanodegree Capstone Project. The aim is develop a set of charecterstics to determine which customers complete which offer type. To explore the customers of Starbucks and their behavior regarding the offers they recieve. Also, to check if we can predict what type of offer is the best for each user based on their demographics.

## File Description <a name="files"></a>

**Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb**: Notebook containing the data analysis. </br>
**Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.html**: An HTML file of the jupyter notebook. </br>
**data/portfolio.json**: containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.). </br>
**data/profile.json**: demographic data for each customer. </br>
**data/transcript.json**: records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed. </br>


## Results <a name="results"></a>
The main findings of the analysis are:</br>
*  </br>
*  </br>
* The models selected were overfitted to the dataset even though the models were simple. Thus, no model were selected to predict the offer type. </br>
